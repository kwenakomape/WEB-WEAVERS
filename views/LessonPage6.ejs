        <h2>Lesson 6: Managing Money</h2>
        <p> In the grand tradition of "keeping the wallet woes at bay," welcome to the sixth week of our course, 
            where we dive into the mysterious art of managing money! Whether you're convinced that your bank account 
            has an escape plan of its own or you're just looking for ways to fund your inevitable coffee addiction, fret not, 
            for we've got your back. Managing money is a skill more elusive than the perfect parking spot on campus, but fear not, 
            for during this session, we will tackle various aspects of financial management. 
            Students are encouraged to watch the following video and respond to the questions provided afterward.
