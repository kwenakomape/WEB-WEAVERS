        <h2>Lesson 2: Time Management</h2>
        <p> Welcome back to Week 2 of our adventure! We're about to tackle a topic that's as crucial as finding a free Wi-Fi spot on campus: Time Management! Effective time management is like the secret sauce to academic success, and trust us, it'll come in handy when you're juggling classes, social events, and maybe a few Netflix binges. So, grab your planners and digital calendars; we're about to dive into the timey-wimey world of managing your day.

            During this session, we'll explore various aspects of time management, from setting priorities to beating procrastination. To get things rolling, students are encouraged to watch the following video and respond to the questions provided afterward.
