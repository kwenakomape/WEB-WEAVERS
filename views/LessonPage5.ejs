        <h2>Lesson 5:  Managing Health</h2>
        <p> Welcome to the fifth week of our course, where we're about to tackle a subject as elusive as that Wi-Fi connection in the library basementâ€”managing your health! As a student, balancing textbooks, assignments, and, let's be honest, the occasional late-night snack attack can be quite the juggling act. But fear not, because during this session, we're diving into various aspects of managing your health. Students are encouraged to watch the following video and respond to the questions provided afterward.
